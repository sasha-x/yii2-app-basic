REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this project template that your Web server supports PHP 5.6.0.


INSTALLATION
------------

### Install via Composer

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

You can then install this project template using the following command:

~~~
composer create-project -s dev --prefer-dist sasha-x/yii2-app-lite lite
~~~

Now you should be able to access the application through the following URL, assuming `basic` is the directory
directly under the Web root.

~~~
http://localhost/basic/web/
~~~

### Install from an Archive File

Extract the archive file downloaded from [yiiframework.com](http://www.yiiframework.com/download/) to
a directory named `basic` that is directly under the Web root.

Set cookie validation key in `config/web.php` file to some random secret string:

```php
'request' => [
    // !!! insert a secret key in the following (if it is empty) - this is required by cookie validation
    'cookieValidationKey' => '<secret random string goes here>',
],
```

You can then access the application through the following URL:

~~~
http://localhost/basic/web/
~~~


### Install with Docker

Update your vendor packages

    docker-compose run --rm php composer update --prefer-dist
    
Run the installation triggers (creating cookie validation code)

    docker-compose run --rm php composer install    
    
Start the container

    docker-compose up -d
    
You can then access the application through the following URL:

    http://127.0.0.1:8000

**NOTES:** 
- Minimum required Docker engine version `17.04` for development (see [Performance tuning for volume mounts](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs-caching/))
- The default configuration uses a host-volume in your home directory `.docker-composer` for composer caches


CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Database

Edit the file `config/db.php` and `config/db-local.php` with real data, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2basic',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```

**NOTES:**
- Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.
- Check and edit the other files in the `config/` directory to customize your application as required.
